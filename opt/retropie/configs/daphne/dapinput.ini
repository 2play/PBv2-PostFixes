# Daphne cutom keyboard and joystick mapping
#
# Each input is mapped to 2 keyboard keys and one joystick button.
# A joystick's first analog stick is also automatically mapped.
#
# The first two numbers are SDL keyboard codes (or 0 for "none")
# Find keyboard codes here:
# http://www.daphne-emu.com/mediawiki/index.php/KeyList
#
# The third number is the joystick button code (or 0 for "none")
# Since 0 is reserved for special meaning, joystick button 0 is identified
# as 1 here.  Button 1 is identified as 2, and so on.
# 
# Find the button you want to map by running:
# jstest /dev/input/js0
# PLAYBOX: COIN=SELECT , START=START, ARRROWS UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT, FIRE1,2,3=B,A,X  , QUIT/EXIT=LEFT THUMBSTICK PRESS (See XBOX LAYOUT)
