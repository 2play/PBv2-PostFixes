Contributing
There are a number of ways you can contribute.

For regular users, please file a bug report if you find a bug. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, including RetroPie version, pi hardware version, and if possible a verbatim capture of the error message, where a copy of the text is preferred to a png of the error.

If you want to learn how Github works, maybe you can open a pull request fixing any typos in the documentation. :D

For technical users, this project needs more pull requests for the exceptions list. I also welcome pull requests to the code base, code reviews, and even pull requests that are nothing more than a clearer comment.

If you feel the need to give a monetary contribution, the only thing I have a heart to accept are GOG.com gifts. If you seriously want to do a monetary contribution, you can contact me on reddit/u/sigb. Contact me for specific requests to determine the feasbility of making the GOG game work, Thank You!
