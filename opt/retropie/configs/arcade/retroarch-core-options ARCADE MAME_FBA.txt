MAME 2003-Plus

Background
MAME 2003-Plus (also referred to as MAME 2003+ and mame2003-plus) is a libretro multi-arcade system emulator core which prioritizes 1) usability and frontend integration, 2) performance, and 3) compatibility across the range of libretro-supported platforms including mobile devices, single board computers, and consoles. MAME 2003-Plus is part of a long tradition in arcade emulation of producing platform-specific and performance-optimized MAME builds.

Why is it called Plus?

Unlike the other 'historic' libretro MAME cores which remain fixed at one MAME version, MAME 2003-Plus is actively maintained and has to date added support for hundreds of new games along with dozens of new features.

MAME 2003-Plus is part of a lineage of codebase forks and ports: this core was forked from MAME 2003, which is itself derived from Xmame 0.78, the X11/Unix port of MAME 0.78.

MAME 2003-Plus has the ability to generate an XML "DAT" file directly from the MAME menu

Building romsets for MAME 2003-Plus
MAME 2003-Plus began with the game drivers from MAME 0.78, meaning that 95% or more of MAME 0.78 romsets will work as-is in MAME 2003-Plus, where they immediately benefit from its bugfixes and other improvements. In order to play the new games and games which received ROM updates in MAME 2003-Plus, you will need to find or build MAME 2003-Plus romsets.

What is a romset?

Arcade games are packaged as zip files, most of which are composed of more than one individual 'ROM' files. That is why some resources inaccurately refer to an individual arcade game as a ROM (like people use to describe a zipped game cartridge ROM) while other resources refer to an individual game as a ROM set, ROMset, or romset.

MAME 2003-Plus has the ability to generate an XML "DAT" file directly from the MAME menu.

Step 1: Obtaining an XML DAT
DAT files describe the exact ROM contents that the emulator needs including filenames, file sizes, and checksums to verify contents are not incorrect or corrupt. mame2003-plus has the ability to generate an XML "DAT" file from the MAME Menu. You can also access the MAME menu by turning it on as a core option, selecting Generate XML DAT and then disabing the menu as a core option.

Step 2: Finding a source for ROMs
In order to build a complete MAME 2003-Plus collection, the ingredients are:

A complete MAME 0.193 or later romset collection
A complete MAME 0.193 or later "rollback" romset collection
MAME 0.78 CHD collection
The NeoGeo UniBIOS 3.3, freely available at http://unibios.free.fr/
Step 3: Building MAME 2003-Plus romsets
Refer to Validating, Rebuilding, and Filtering ROM Collections for details on how to configure ClrMamePro to use your sources as "rebuild" folders.

We recommend the Full Non-Merged format, where each romset zip files includes all the files needed to run each game, including any ROMs from 'parent' ROM sets and BIOS sets. To configure ClrMamePro to validate or rebuild a Full Non-Merged collection, use "Non-Merged" mode and disable "Separate BIOS Sets" from the "Advanced" menu in both ClrMamePro's Rebuild and Scanner menus.

Tip

A complete Full Non-Merged romset collection with CHDs and Samples only requires approximately 6% more storage space than the Split format romsets that are also sometimes used to structure arcade romsets. MAME 2003-Plus can read Split, TorrentZipped romsets, but the RetroArch playlist scanner only supports Full Non-Merged, TorrentZipped romsets for MAME 2003-Plus.

Recommended ClrMamePro settings
ClrMamePro remains the most popular tool for rebuilding MAME romsets, at least for now. That said, ClrMamePro is focused on supporting more recent MAME versions so there are at least two things to know if you are using ClrMamePro to generate a MAME 2003-Plus set:

If you are scanning CHDs, go to Settings -> Compressor -> CHDMan tab and change Req. CHD Version to 3.
If you are using the suggested setting of Disable Separate BIOS Sets then ClrMamePro will report the BIOS romset files as missing even though you told the program you don't want them. mame2003-plus incorporates 15 different kinds of BIOS romsets, so it is normal to see a ClrMamePro message like this after a clean and complete scan: You are missing 15 of 4831 known mame2003-plus.xml sets (+ BIOS sets)
Sourcing CHDs
MAME 2003-Plus uses exactly the same MAME 0.78 CHDs (CHD v3) as MAME 2003.

BIOS
BIOS romsets are not needed when using "Full Non-Merged" arcade romsets. For "Split" and "Non-Merged" romsets, place the BIOS in the same directory as the game romset.

Keyboard Input
mame_keyboard sets the core to process keyboard input directly through the legacy "MAME" keyboard interface. Use this input mode only if your input device is seen as a keyboard, including some arcade control panel hardware.

Mouse and trackball support
MAME 2003-Plus has support for multiple mice or touch devices in games that support trackballs, etc. MAME 2003-Plus also supports one or two spinners/dials via the "Share 2 player dial controls across one X/Y device" core option. By default, mice/trackballs and analog sticks (the left one, for controllers with 2) are supported in games that would have them, or equivalents. For example, Centipede supports the mouse/trackball, and Afterburner supports the stick.

Pointer, trackpad, touchscreen support
Absolute pointer devices are supported, but need to be turned on via the corresponding core option.

Lightgun support
Because MAME 2003-Plus does not yet implement the libretro lightgun API, the core currently supports lightguns only if they are configured to emulate a mouse.

Audio samples
Some games require an additional zip file with recorded sounds or music in order for audio to work correctly. Audio 'sample' files should be placed in a samples subdirectory within /libretro system dir/mame2003-plus/.

Alternate CD soundtrack support

MAME 2003-Plus also supports alternate soundtracks for several popular arcade titles that were also released in other formats with high quality audio soundtracks. Alternate soundtracks are supported for Double Dragon, Final Fight, Mortal Kombat, Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker, NBA Jam, and Out Run.



Core options
Tip
Restart core indicates that the core must be restarted in order for changes to that option to take effect.

Content-aware core options
Because MAME 2003-Plus supports more than 4,000 games, there are a number of core options which only apply to a subset of its library. For example, there are several options to configure vector displays which have no effect for games with any other kind of display. MAME 2003-Plus only presents core options to the frontend that are relevant to the game that is currently loaded In other words, the vector options only appear when a vector game is currently loaded.

Core option	Description
4-way joystick emulation on 8-way joysticks	See 4-way joystick simulation section of this doc. mame2003-plus_four_way_emulation = "enabled|disabled"

Control Mapping	See the Analog and digital controller support section of this doc. mame2003-plus_analog = "analog|digital"

Dual joystick mode	Note: This option may affect stateless netplay between two users with the option set differently. Reassigns the Player 2 joystick as a second joystick for Player 1. This is intended for emulating cabints with Dual Joystick designs.
Map right analog stick as but tons	Provides an alternative mapping for users with unused right analog sticks.

Vector resolution multiplier (Restart core)	Attempts to create a higher quality emulation of vector display hardware by upscaling the emulated display to a higher resolution. mame2003-plus_vector_resolution = "1024x768|640x480|1280x960|1440x1080|1600x1200|original"

Vector antialiasing	Enables or disables the anti-aliasing for vector games. mame2003-plus_vector_antialias = "enabled|disabled"

Vector beam width	Sets the emulated width of the vector beam in pixels. This setting is only effective when anti-aliasing is enabled. mame2003-plus_vector_beam_width = "2|1|1.2|1.4|1.6|1.8|2.5|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12"

Vector translucency	Emulates the partial transparency of vector display hardware.

Vector flicker	Emulates the flicker of vector display hardware. mame2003-plus_vector_flicker = "20|0|10|30|40|50|60|70|80|90|1001.5|0.5|1|2|2.5|3"

Vector intensity	Emulates the variable intensity of vector display hardware. mame2003-plus_vector_intensity = "1.5|0.5|1|2|2.5|3"

DCS Speedhack	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. Use so-called "speed hacks" to improve the performance of DCS sound hardware. mame2003-plus_dcs_speedhack = "enabled|disabled"

Locate system files within a subfolder	For historical reasons, MAME 2003-Plus reads system files within a subfolder named mame2003-plus even though this is not part of the libretro API. mame2003-plus_core_sys_subfolder = "enabled|disabled"

Locate save files within a subfolder	For historical reasons, MAME 2003-Plus saves files within a subfolder named mame2003-plus even though this is not part of the libretro API. mame2003-plus_core_save_subfolder = "enabled|disabled"

TATE Mode	From the Japanese 縦 (ta-te) meaning "vertical", TATE Mode renders vertical games lengthwise along the display. This mode is intended for use with rotating monitors and portable devices that can make the full use of their viewable area for games which used vertical monitors. mame2003-plus_tate_mode = "disabled|enabled"

Brightness	Simple brightness adjustment. mame2003-plus_brightness = "1.0|0.2|0.3|0.4|0.5|0.6|0.7|0.8|0.9|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5|1.6|1.7|1.8|1.9|2.0"

Gamma correction	Simple gamma adjustment. mame2003-plus_gamma = "1.0|0.5|0.6|0.7|0.8|0.9|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5|1.6|1.7|1.8|1.9|2.0"

Frameskip	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. mame2003-plus_frameskip = "0|1|2|3|4|5"

Sample Rate (KHz)	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. mame2003-plus_sample_rate = "48000|8000|11025|22050|30000|44100"

Input interface	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. retropad, the default option, processes input via the libretro retropad abstraction, including from any keyboard which are bound to the retropad. The keyboard setting only sends keyboard input directly to the core, ignoring the retropad. The simultaneous setting sends inputs both ways at the same time and is not recommended. This setting exists for historical reasons. mame2003-plus_input_interface = "retropad|keyboard|simultaneous"

Legacy Remapping	Note: Using the legacy MAME control remapper may affect stateless netplay between two users with their MAME remappings set differently. mame2003-plus_mame_remapping = "enabled|disabled"
Display artwork (Restart core)	Display artwork packs from within the core, particularly "backdrop" artwork. mame2003-plus_display_artwork = "enabled|disabled"

Artwork resolution multiplier (Restart core)	Upscales games with artwork backs so that the artwork can be displayed at a higher resolution. mame2003-plus_art_resolution = "1|2"

NVRAM Bootstraps	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. mame2003-plus_nvram_bootstraps = "enabled|disabled"

Dip switch/Cheat input ports	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. Activates a few specific cheats that manipulate the dipswitch input system. mame2003-plus_cheat_input_ports = "disabled|enabled"

Bypass audio skew (Restart core)	Advanced feature: changing from the default is not recommended in most cases. Bypass the frontend's "audio skew" feature which attempts to adjust the audio for games which displayed at framerates not native to modern displays. mame2003-plus_machine_timing = "enabled|disabled"

MAME 2003

Background
MAME 2003 is a libretro arcade system emulator core originally derived from xmame 0.78. This core is a popular choice for the Raspberry Pi family and other low-powered hardware because it supports most 2D-era arcade games and a broad set of features without requiring as much processor and memory resources as later MAME cores.

Extensions
zip

BIOS
BIOS romsets are not needed when using "Full Non-Merged" arcade romsets. For "Split" and "Non-Merged" romsets, place the BIOS in the same directory as the game romset.


Core options MAME 2003
Frameskip (0-5): Skips frame to make slow emulation look faster than it is while compromising playability. (Not advised)

DCS Speedhack (On/Off): Speedhack for the Midway sound hardware used in Mortal Kombat 2, 3 and others. Improves performance in these games.

Skip Disclaimer (On/Off): Skips the 'nag-screen'.

Skip Warnings (On/Off): Skips the warning screen shown before games with incomplete emulation.

Samples (On/Off): Requires valid sample zip files. | - |

Sample Rate (11025-48000): Lowering may improve performance on weaker devices.

Cheats (On/Off): Requires a valid cheat.dat file.
Share 2 player dial controls across one X/Y device (On/Off): Some dial/spinner hardware are actually one device with one axis for each player. This supports that setup, by breaking down the normal mouse x/y into two seperate inputs.

Mouse Device (mouse/pointer/disabled): Switch between mouse (e.g. hardware mouse, trackball, etc), pointer (touchpad, touchscreen, lightgun, etc), or disabled.

TATE Mode (On/Off): Enable if rotating display for vertically oriented games (Pac-Man, Galaga, etc). Requires video_allow_rotate = "false" setting in RetroArch.cfg or core override file.
