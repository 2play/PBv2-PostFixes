Amstrad - CPC (Caprice32)
Amstrad - CPC (TOSEC)

Background
Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer series running on Linux and Windows. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, CPC6128, CPC6128+ and GX4000 models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a low level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with original CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at real-time or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.

Extensions
Content that can be loaded by the Caprice32 core have the following file extensions:

.dsk
.sna
.tap
.cdt
.voc
.m3u
.cpr
.zip

M3U and Disk control
When you have a multi disk game, you can use a m3u file to specify each disk of the game and change them from the RetroArch Disk control interface.

A M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U).

Example: Alive (F).m3u


Alive (F) - Disk 1A.dsk
Alive (F) - Disk 1B.dsk
Path can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.

When a game ask for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch 'Disk Control' menu:

Eject the current disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'
Select the right disk index
Insert the new disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'
Geometry and timing
The Caprice32 core's core provided FPS is 50
The Caprice32 core's core provided sample rate is 44.100
The Caprice32 core's core provided aspect ratio is Â¾
Usage
The Caprice32 core has a virtual keyboard GUI that can be accessed through User 1's RetroPad Y input.
