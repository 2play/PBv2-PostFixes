Recoil Terms and Conditions
The recoil functionality has been designed to be as safe to use as possible on your equipment.
However it must be used at users own risk, Sinden Technology is not responsible for any damage to user's equipment.
Each recoil lightgun requires a continual draw of 500mA which is a common standard for USB ports.
If your equipment is not capable of providing that current due to inadequate power supply or any other reason 
then it is possible equipment could be damaged.
If you are unsure whether your equipment can provide this amount of power or the equipment being used is expensive 
or may be difficult to repair then it is recommended to use a powered USB hub with an adequate power supply.
As the Sinden Lightgun recoil can create a loud noise depending on the settings, it is recommended to keep the lightgun a safe distance away 
from your ears to prevent any risk of hearing damage.  For this reason it is advised to not allow children under 18 to use the Sinden Lightgun 
recoil who may not be able to judge a safe sound volume.
Sinden Technology is not responsible for any hearing damage due to usage of the Sinden Lightgun.
